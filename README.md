# The Metrics System

Monitoring is the process of maintaining surveillance over the existence and magnitude of state change and data flow in a system. Monitoring aims to identify faults and assist in their subsequent elimination.

Metrics are a measurement at a point in time for the system. This unit of measure can have the value, timestamp, and identifier of what that value applies to (like a source or a tag). Metrics are typically collected at fixed-time intervals. These are referred to as the resolution.

This project was build for enabling developers easy to monitor their systems.
